Steps to build a new RPM:

1. Ensure that the ROOT variable is defined correctly at the top of the 'build_rpm' script such that
   it points to the root of the cloned fairdata-sso git repository. E.g.

   ROOT="/var/fairdata-sso"

2. Update the 'rpmspec' file to define the new version and release of the new package.

   The version should be in the form Major.Minor.Patch and the release should correspond
   to the release date in the form YYYYMMDD with no hyphens.

3. Execute the script build_rpm. The generated package (if no errors are encountered)
   will be located in the /packages subdirectory.

4. After a successful build, commit all changes, including the newly generated
   package, and push to GitHub for preservation.

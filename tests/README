This subdirectory contains behavioral, integration, and end-to-end tests, and
their related utilities and resources, used to validate proper behavior and
functionality of the Fairdata SSO service in a manner agnostic to its underlying 
implementation.


RUNNING TESTS

The root /fairdata-sso/tests folder contains a script 'run-tests' which will locate
and run all tests, or a subset of tests, depending on the arguments provided.

Further details and examples are provided in the comments of the script.


RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WRITING TESTS

Each logical suite of tests should be executable by providing the package path
as a single parameter to the 'run-tests' script.

During execution of the tests, each set of logically related tests should be
indicated by outputting a status line containing a heading matching the pattern
"--- Heading" (typically output as part of the setup).

Prior to each specific test assertion, operation, action, a status line should be
output containing a brief summary, describing the behavioral action being executed.
(e.g. "Retrieve login page", etc.) If the action should not be allowed or possible,
the summary should start with the "Attempt to", e.g "Attempt to retrieve session
details without token", etc.)

When setting up for tests, output a status message "(initializing)". When cleaning
up after tests, output a status message "(cleaning)".

See the existing test execution for examples.

The summary of all test set headings and summaries should serve as documentation of
the functional test coverage provided by the implemented tests.
